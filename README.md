# NLP-Logix-Internship


Code used during the nlp logix internship, more refined and original

Data visualizations and machine learning code utilized for the NLP Logix Summer Internship.

I participated in NLP Logix's Data Science Boot Camp Summer Internship program, an internship that lasts for 5 weeks, every Monday/Wednesday/Friday from 1 PM - 5 PM.

I was able to join due to being recommended by my guidance counselor, and being selected by the NLP team.

In this internship, I was able to learn about the fundamentals of data science, including data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and even business focused presentation skills.

Through using an NFL Play-by-Play Data Set containing over 450,000 rows of data with 255 columns, utilizing programs like Tableau, Anaconda, and Visual Studio Code for Python, I was able to construct multiple graphs and dashboards highlighting NFL play trends, constructed a predictive model (predicting run or pass) with about 80% accuracy, and even presented our findings to the analytics team of the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the NLP Logix team
